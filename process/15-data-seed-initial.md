## What changed

Bulk-loaded the team's real customers, projects, employees, salaries, invoices, and expenses into the live database via the Supabase Management API SQL endpoint and Auth admin endpoint. Done from a one-shot Node script (`process/.seed-initial.mjs`, gitignored — contains the service role key) so the work is auditable without touching client code.

### Team

| Email | Role | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| wkh0000@gmail.com | super_admin | founder (Kasun Wachindra) — linked to "Kasun Wachindra" employee record |
| tharinduinduwara44@gmail.com | member | new — linked to "Tharindu Induwara" employee record. Temp password recorded in `process/.credentials.local.md` |
| test+member@weddz.lk | member | leftover from QA. Can be deactivated via `/admin/users` if you want a clean roster. |

### Salaries (all paid, all auto-rolled into expenses)

| Employee | Period | Net | Paid on |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tharindu Induwara | 2026-03 | LKR 110,000 | 2026-04-01 |
| Tharindu Induwara | 2026-04 | LKR 110,000 | 2026-05-01 |
| Kasun Wachindra | 2026-04 | LKR 110,000 | 2026-05-01 |

Each row inserts both the salary record and the corresponding `Salary` expense row linked via `salary_id`. Same shape `pay_salary()` produces — done directly because the seed runs as DB superuser, not as an authenticated user, and `pay_salary` enforces `is_super_admin()` which evaluates against `auth.uid()`.

## How

`process/.seed-initial.mjs` (gitignored) does:

1. Calls `POST https://{ref}.supabase.co/auth/v1/admin/users` with the service role key to create Tharindu's auth user with `email_confirm: true` (skip verification email).
2. Runs a single `DO $$ … END $$` block via `POST https://api.supabase.com/v1/projects/{ref}/database/query`. Inside the block: declares uuid variables, inserts everything in dependency order (employees → customers → projects → columns → invoices+items → salaries → expenses), and uses `RETURNING id INTO v_*` to chain references.
3. Runs an aggregate `SELECT` to print the row counts.

Verification ran via `process/.verify-seed.mjs` (also gitignored). Output (abridged):

```
Onscene event web        budget 4,950,000   paid 500,000   exp 10,000
Nugawela wine stores     budget   380,000   paid 100,000   exp      0
Travel quotation system  budget   285,000   paid       0   exp  1,500
Retail POS               budget    45,000   paid       0   exp      0
LMS                      budget   300,000   paid  30,000   exp  1,500

General total: 34,500     Salary expenses total: 330,000
INV-0001 INV-0002 INV-0003 — all paid
3 salaries — all paid
3 profiles — founder + Test Member (QA leftover) + Tharindu
```

## Open follow-ups

- Old QA leftovers in DB:
  - Customer `Anjali Perera / Lotus Hospitality`
  - Project `Lotus Reservations CRM`
  - Profile `test+member@weddz.lk`
  - Task "Initial product brief from Anjali" inside Lotus board

  All can be deleted via the UI when you want a clean dataset.

- The two seed scripts (`process/.seed-initial.mjs`, `process/.verify-seed.mjs`) are gitignored — they hold the service role key. They sit in your local `process/` folder if you ever want to re-run or reference them.
